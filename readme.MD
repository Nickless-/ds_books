## Data Science

#### [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction.](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) 
    
    Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman
    Springer; 2nd Edition; Jan 2017
        
"This book descibes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book."


## Deep Learning

#### [Machine Learning Yearning - Technical Strategy for AI Engineers, in the Era of Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning/) 
    
    Andrew Ng
    
"This book is focused not on teaching you ML algorithms, but on how to make ML algorithms work."

#### [The fastai book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) 
    
    Jeremy Howard, Sylvain Gugger
    2020
    
"These notebooks cover an introduction to deep learning, fastai, and PyTorch. fastai is a layered API for deep learning."

## Natural Language Processing

#### [Natural Language Processing with Python - Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/book/) 
    
    Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper
    O'Reilly; 1st edition

"This book provides a highly accessible introduction to the field of NLP. It can be used for individual study or as the textbook for a course on natural language processing or computational linguistics, or as a supplement to courses in artificial intelligence, text mining, or corpus linguistics. The book is intensely practical, containing hundreds of fully-worked examples and graded exercises."

## R

#### [An Introduction to Statistical Learning - with Applications in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) 
    
    Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani
    Springer; January 2017
        
"This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist."


#### [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) 
    
    Garrett Grolemund, Hadley Wickham
    O'Reilly; January 2017
        
"This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots - and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data."

#### [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)

    Hadley Wickham
    2nd Edition
        
"The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it helps you to understand why R works the way it does."
    
Solutions for the exercises can be found [here](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/).

#### [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) 
    
    Hadley Wickham, Jennifer Bryan
    O'Reilly; 2nd Edition
    
"Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. In this book you'll learn how to turn your code into packages that others can easily download and use. Writing a package can seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over time. It doesn't matter if your first version isn't perfect as long as the next version is better."

#### [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/) 
    
    Roger D. Peng
    2020
        
"This book is about the fundamentals of R programming. You will get started with the basics of the language, learn how to manipulate datasets, how to write functions, and how to debug and optimize code. With the fundamentals provided in this book, you will have a solid foundation on which to build your data science toolbox."

#### [Exploratory Data Analysis with R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/) 
    
    Roger D. Peng
    2020
        
"This book covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data with R."
